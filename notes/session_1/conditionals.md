# Conditionals and logical operators
## Comparison operators
In Python we can use special symbolic operators
to make logical comparisons

|Operator| Meaning                                                                                | Example |
|--------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------:|
| >      | Greater than. Returns true if left operand is greater than the right                   | a > b   |
| <      | Less than. Returns true if left operand is less than the right                         | a < b   |
| >=     | Greater than or equal to. True if left operand is greater than or equal to the right   | a >= b  |
| <=     | Less than or equal to - True if left operand is less than or equal to the right        | a <= b  |
| ==     | Equal to. Returns true if both operands are equal                                      | a == b  |
| !=     | Not equal to. returns true if operands are not equal                                   | a != b  |

## Conditional operators
In python we can use conditional operators in order to execute code based on a given condition

```python
a = 10
b = 5

if a > b:
  print(f`{a} is greater than {b}`)
else:
  print(f`{a} is not greater than {b}')

start_of_range = 10
end_of_range = 20

if num
```
